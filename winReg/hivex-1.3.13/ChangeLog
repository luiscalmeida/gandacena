2015-10-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.3.13.

	Enable more warnings in configure.
	Includes some minor fixes in hivexsh.c to deal with the new warnings.

	sh: Use %u formatter to print enum strtol_error.

	sh: Cast value to unsigned type when printing dword: field.

	hive_type enum needs %u printf formatter.

	lib: block->seg_len is signed, use correct printf formatter.

	lib: h->last_modified field is signed, so use correct printf formatter.

	lib: Turn off -Warray-bounds warnings.
	Causes false positives about our use of [1] for arbitrary length
	arrays embedded in structs.

	Update gnulib to latest.

	Don't fail if libxml2 is not installed (RHBZ#1276364).
	If no libxml2 found, don't compile hivexml, but compile the
	rest of the library.

2015-10-21  Pino Toscano  <ptoscano@redhat.com>

	build: pass $(MAKE) to run-perl-tests
	Instead of hardcoding "make" in run-perl-tests, pass the actual name of
	make from the Makefile; the default is still "make", mostly to use the
	script without having to set $MAKE.

2015-10-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix EXTRA_DIST.
	This fixes commit 6047a47da9e664cd589aa22ab65d9168d834fa5b.

	Version 1.3.12.

2015-10-05  Pino Toscano  <ptoscano@redhat.com>

	Update .gitignore with more gnulib files.

	Update gnulib to latest.

2015-10-05  Pino Toscano  <ptoscano@redhat.com>

	Fix shebang in perl scripts
	Instead of hardcoding the location of perl (assuming it is installed in
	/usr), use /usr/bin/env to run it, and thus picking it from $PATH.
	This makes it possible to run these scripts also on installations with
	perl in a different prefix than /usr.

	Also, given that we want enable warnings on scripts, turn the -w
	previously in shebang to explicit "use warnings;" in scripts which
	didn't have it before.

	(This is the same change as d98c9c0e0b4d259f49825fc360bc7e6cafbdd644

	lib: Don't leak errno from _hivex_recode function.
	If iconv returns E2BIG, that's an internal indication for us, and not
	an error.  Don't leak the errno up to the user, as happened here:

	https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2014-November/msg00140.html

	Thanks Nicolas Ecarnot.

2014-11-20  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	lib: Increase HIVEX_MAX_SUBKEYS to 25000.
	Thanks Nicolas Ecarnot who found a HKLM\SOFTWARE hive from a Windows
	XP machine which had an nk containing 18254 subkeys ( > current limit
	of 15000).

2014-11-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	lib: Increase HIVEX_MAX_VALUE_LEN to 8000000.
	I encountered a hive that contained a key of 3_886_561 bytes length in
	a key called 'HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\services\mfeavfk' (apparently
	belonging to "McAfee Anti-virus software").

	The previous limit was set arbitrarily at 2_000_000 bytes.  Increase
	it to cope with this larger key.

	ruby: fix detection of ruby library
	Query RbConfig::CONFIG for "libdir", and use that when trying to link to
	the ruby library.  This fixes the libruby detection when it is installed
	in a non-standard library directory.

	(This is the same change as 3d02e53c48266669675cc237f61ae2c4e1816e66

2014-11-06  Pino Toscano  <ptoscano@redhat.com>

	normalize iconv handling
	Since the signature of iconv() changes between implementations (the
	constness of the second parameter, in particular), make use of the iconv
	module of gnulib to handle these potential differences.

	(This is a reduced version of 57512e778558c5b93cfa360c83836c2cf8fc5908
	in libguestfs.)

2014-10-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.3.11.
	Also update translations from transifex.

	extra-tests: Add trivial fuzz tester.
	Could be improved greatly, but it's a start.

	handle: Check that pages do not extend beyond the end of the file.
	Thanks: Mahmoud Al-Qudsi

2014-10-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	handle: Refuse to open files < 8192 bytes in size.
	These cannot be valid hives, since they don't contain a full header
	page and at least a single page of data (in other words they couldn't
	contain a root node).

	value: Set errno = 0 on non-error path in hivex_value_data_cell_offset (RHBZ#1145056).
	hivex_value_data_cell_offset may return 0 to indicate that the data is
	inline.  This is not an error return, but it was possible for errno to
	have a random (non-zero) value along this path.  Explicitly set errno
	= 0 on this path.

	generator: Fix mixed tabs/spaces
	vim :set ts=8 :retab

	python: add heavier tests for setvalue
	Ensure that invalid types are not silently ignored (and test to avoid
	segfaults).

2014-08-18  Peter Wu  <peter@lekensteyn.nl>

	python: fix crash by validating key and value
	User-visible changes: no crashes if you try to pass a non-str type as
	key/value in Python 3. Exceptions are thrown rather than silently
	ignoring type violations (such as passing a Unicode string as value
	in Python 2).

	Until now, Python 2 keys and values were assumes to be bytes, in
	Python 3 these were seen as Unicode strings instead. Remove the
	compile-check for a deprecated Python 2 function (`PyString_AsString`)
	and check for byte types instead.

	For keys, accept both strings and bytes as the common case is to pass
	a ASCII string name. (The `\u20ac` Unicode character (Euro-sign) is
	apparently also valid as key name, verified with Python 3 and
	Windows 7).

	For values, be more conservative and reject all types except bytes. This
	better matches the C API and removes the burden of character conversion
	from the wrapper. Instead, callers should know the correct encoding
	and terminate strings.

	Modify tests to specify bytes instead of strings. (Otherwise Python 3
	would break while Python 2 still passes.)

2014-08-18  Peter Wu  <peter@lekensteyn.nl>

	python: check some types for get_value
	Recognise early that a value passed to node_get_value is not a dict
	rather than spitting out "no 'key' element in dictionary".

	Detect errors for invalid `t` elements instead of silently using `-1`.

2014-08-18  Peter Wu  <peter@lekensteyn.nl>

	python: use PyErr_NoMemory
	If malloc fails, just throw a NoMemory exception rather than showing
	"RuntimeError: Cannot allocate memory".

2014-08-18  Peter Wu  <peter@lekensteyn.nl>

	python: use errors more specific than RuntimeError
	KeyError is documented as:
	"Raised when a mapping (dictionary) key is not found in the set of
	existing keys."

	TypeError is documented as:
	"Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of
	inappropriate type."

	RuntimeError is documented as:
	"Raised when an error is detected that doesn’t fall in any of the other
	categories."

	Let's be more specific with exceptions. The exception all inherit from
	StandardError (and from Exception), but not from RuntimeError, so this
	might need some code changes (if users would catch this specific error).
	However, this behavior was not documented so it is perfectly fine to
	change it.

2014-08-12  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Ignore python/hivex directory.
	It contains only generated files.

2014-08-12  Peter Wu  <peter@lekensteyn.nl>

	python: export hive_types constants
	Instead of using magic numbers or copying the numbers all over place,
	make the hive type constants available so you can do:

	    import hivex
	    from hivex.hive_types import *

	    h = hivex.Hivex ("../images/minimal", write = True)
	    new_value = { "key": "abc", "t": REG_BINARY, "value": b"xyz" }
	    h.node_set_value (h.root (), new_value)

2014-08-12  Peter Wu  <peter@lekensteyn.nl>

	python: move module to separate directory
	This allows submodules to be added under the 'hivex' namespace. A new
	`pythonmoddir` variable was added for separating libhivexmod.so and the
	Python hivex module.

2014-08-12  Peter Wu  <peter@lekensteyn.nl>

	Fix overly long assertion string
	With GCC 4.9.1 I get a -Woverlength-strings warning:
	hivex-internal.h:123:23: error: string length ‘3823’ is greater than ...
	   (STREQLEN (((struct ntreg_hbin_block *)((char *) (h)->addr + (offs)))->id, (eqid), 2))

	The compile command can be shortened to:

	    cd lib && cpp -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I.. -I../gnulib/lib  -I. \
	        -Woverlength-strings -Werror -g -O2 write.c

	After that, be amazed at the huge assertion string produced by the
	macro which is also visible in libhivex.so (two times).

	To fix that mess, use an inline function. The `STR*` macros were moved
	and a string.h header added since STREQLEN is used in the function.

	lib: Promote byte_conversions.h #include to hivex-internal.h
	This patch addresses a build failure in OS X.  Running git-bisect on a
	straightforward build (bootstrap, autogen.sh, configure, make, make
	install) showed this as the "Bad commit:"
	3e7c039799cddc45517350cc917eb10715f33fec

	The issue is that hivex-internal.h uses le32toh in a static inline
	function.  In case `configure` doesn't find le32toh, byte_conversions.h
	defines it.  But hivex-internal.h doesn't include the safety definition.

	OS X demonstrates this a problem.  Neither endian.h nor byteswap.h are
	found with `configure` in OS X 10.8.5 (XCode 5), but the headers are
	both found in Fedora 19 and Ubuntu 13.04.  This patch to configure.ac
	further logs that only ntohl is available for byte swaps:

	    @@ -153,6 +153,8 @@ AC_REPLACE_FUNCS([mmap])
	     dnl Functions.
	     AC_CHECK_FUNCS([bindtextdomain])

	    +AC_CHECK_FUNCS([le32toh ntohl bswap_32 __bswap_32])
	    +

	(As an aside, it's curious that a missing byteswap.h didn't cause
	hivex-internal.h to fail to build.)
	(As another aside, this is an interesting example of lazy symbol
	binding failing with an inline function.)

	The problem is resolved by having hivex-internal.h include
	byte_conversions.h.  This obviates most of the other direct inclusions
	of byte_conversions.h.  (One persists under sh/.)

	This patch builds and runs hivexml on images/large fine in Ubuntu 13.04
	and Fedora 19.  It also allows builds to succeed in OS X, but doesn't
	run hivexml for an unrelated reason.  The _iconv_open
	symbol-not-found issue, that I thought was previously resolved
	(491ba0f7a761c7ffd50e0eaa4d892f78d538eb2b), resurfaced.

2013-09-10  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	ppc: Fix endianness bug which caused node_add_child to fail.
	Code used:

	  le32toh (reg_field + 0x1000)

	instead of the correct version:

	  le32toh (reg_field) + 0x1000

	The first incorrect form adds 0x1000 to the possibly byte-swapped
	registry field, corrupting it.

	I used the following command to look for problems in the remaining
	code but did not find any:

	  git grep -P 'le\d+toh\s*\([^)]*\+'

	NOTE that 'htole32 (reg_field - 0x1000)' is correct.

2013-06-25  Hilko Bengen  <bengen@hilluzination.de>

	Add read support for "big data" blocks to hivex
	Large values are split into multiple blocks. References to these
	sub-blocks are kept in a list whose structure seems to be identical to
	a value list.

	A "db" record contains information on the number of sub-blocks and a
	pointer to the list. It is referenced by the vk record.

	I came across this when comparing the contents of HKLM\SOFTWARE hives
	from Windows7 systems and finding that hivex_value_value would only give
	me identical first 12 bytes for certain records though the data size had
	changed. If one runs hivexsh with debug messages enabled, it gives a
	warning when listing these values, for example:

	SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\AuthRoot\AutoUpdate> lsval
	[...]
	hivex_value_value: warning: declared data length is longer than the
	block it is in (data 0x28b9b60, data len 115347, block len 16)
	"EncodedCtl"=hex(3):64,62,08,00,70,8b,8b,02,00,b2,00,00

2013-06-19  Hilko Bengen  <bengen@hilluzination.de>

	Relax size checks for integer types
	I recenetly came across a Windows XP image, where one REG_QWORD value
	(HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Group Policy\State\Machine\Scripts\Shutdown\0\0\ExecTime)
	would be displayed by hivexsh but hivex_value_qword() would return -1.

	It turned out that the data length of this value was 16 bytes instead
	of 8.

	There is no problem in simply interpreting the first 4 (DWORD) or
	8 (QWORD) bytes -- if there are enough bytes to be interpreted.

	Mac OS X: Link iconv in libhivex
	hivexml on OS X was failing with a symbol-not-found error while
	dynamically linking.  Adding iconv to libhivex fixes the issue and lets
	OS X process 'images/large' with hivexml.

	It took careful iconv autotool additions to get compilation working in
	Fedora as well, but these two lines build and run on OS X 10.6 and
	10.8, and Fedora 17 and 18.

	Unfortunately, a separate issue is revealed here in OS X, as some of
	the hivexml value data appears as Kanji.  However, that is an issue
	distinct from getting the program to run.

	arm: Prevent cast-align warnings.
	The implicit alignment of char* is 1 byte, so on ARM we get a
	cast-align warning whenever we try to cast this to a larger type
	(eg. casting to uint32_t).

	The implicit alignment of void* is whatever malloc returns, and so
	this can be cast to any type.

	The cost of this is that we have to add (char *) casts all over the

	patch for read support of "li"-records from "ri" intermediate
	Richard,

	Thank you for creating the hivex-library. Studying your source code helped
	me a great deal to better understand the internals of the Windows Registry.

	However, while I was browsing a real-world SOFTWARE-hive (XP, SP3) I
	could not browse to the '\Classes' key. Instead I got this (debug)-message:

	    get_children: returning ENOTSUP because ri-record offset does not
	point to lf/lh (0x49020)

	I tracked this issue down and I discovered that the intermediate
	"ri"-record may not only contain offsets to "lf" and "lh" but to
	"li"-records too.

	Attached is a patch against hivex.c v1.3.3 that recognises
	"li"-records referenced from "ri"-records. For me this fixed the issue
	with browsing the '\Classes' key.

	Note that I have not fixed the related problem of rewriting
	"li"-records when inserting a new subkey or deleting an
	existing one. This sure would cause problems when I were to
	add/delete a subkey to/from '\Classes'.

	RWMJ:
	The original patch submitted is here:
	https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2012-March/msg00035.html
	Changes made:
	 - Removed commented-out code for writing.
	 - Re-added some checking code to reduce the delta of this patch
	   to the previous code.  The checks can be removed in a separate
	   patch if necessary.

	This fixes an in-tree build failure on a Debian/sid system (see

	to a missing include path, in this case the system's getopt

	Report last-modified time of hive root and nodes
	The infrastructure for modified-time reporting has been essentially
	unused.  These changes report the registry time by treating the
	time fields as Windows filetime fields stored in little-Endian
	(which means they can be treated as a single 64-bit little-Endian
	integer).

	This patch adds to the hivex ABI:

	 * int64_t hivex_last_modified (hive_h *)
	 * int64_t hivex_node_timestamp (hive_h *, hive_node_h)

	These two functions return the hive's last-modified time and
	a particular node's last-modified time, respectively.  Credit
	to Richard Jones for the ABI suggestion, and for the tip on
	Microsoft's filetime time span.

	hivexml employs these two functions to produce mtime elements
	for a hive and all of its nodes, producing ISO-8601 formatted
	time.

	perl: Fix CCFLAGS on Perl 5.14.
	A change to ExtUtils::CBuilder in Perl 5.14 causes CCFLAGS to
	completely replace, rather than appending, the C flags.

	The unfortunate consequence of this is that vital flags such as
	-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 are missing.  For 32 bit code, this means you
	get binary-incompatible code that completely fails to load.

	For further analysis see:

	http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2011/04/msg171535.html

	This commit changes CCFLAGS so that it appends to the existing
	$Config{ccflags} instead of replacing it.  On earlier versions of Perl
	this means we get two copies of the flags, which is unfortunate but
	should be safe.

	hivex/python fix for i386 integer size issue
	Hi,

	While working on Debian packages of hivex 1.2.5, I came across a test
	failure for the Python bindings with Python 2.7 on the i386
	architecture. (The tests ran fine on amd64.)

	,----
	| $ make -C python check
	| make[1]: Entering directory `/home/bengen/src/deb/hivex/hivex.git/python'
	| 010-import.py
	| 020-open.py
	| 021-close.py
	| 200-write.py
	| python: hivex-py.c:52: get_handle: Assertion `obj' failed.
	`----

	I narrowed this down to hivex-py.c:py_hivex_node_add_child():

	The call

	,----
	| PyArg_ParseTuple (args, (char *) "OLs:hivex_node_add_child",
	|                         &py_h, &parent, &name)
	`----

	results in `py_h' set to NULL, though Python's documentation claims that
	this cannot happen. I think this happens because `parent' is declared a
	`long int', but "L" in the format string corresponds to a `long long'.
	On amd64, they have the same size, but on i386 they don't, so the
	PyObject pointer is written to the wrong address.

	Please consider applying the patch below which just changes the format
	string. After regenerating hivex-py.c, I have successfully tested the
	1.2.5 code base on both architectures.

	Cheers,
	-Hilko

2011-04-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex_value_multiple_strings: Don't read uninitialized data.
	If hivex_value_multiple_strings was given a value which had an odd
	length or if the data in the value was unterminated,
	hivex_value_multiple_strings could read uninitialized data.

	Potentially (although very unlikely) this could cause a
	non-exploitable segfault in the calling program.

2011-04-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Handle odd-length "UTF16" strings.
	If the length of the buffer is not even, then this would read a byte
	of uninitialized data.  Fix the length check to avoid this.

2011-04-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Return real length of buffer from hivex_value_value.
	In real registries, often the length declared in the header does not
	match the length of the block.  In this case hivex_value_value would
	only allocate a value with a size which is the shorter of the two
	length values, which is correct and safe.

	However user code could do:

	  buf = hivex_value_value (h, v, &t, &len);
	  memcpy (somewhere, buf, len);

	which would copy uninitialized data.

	If hivex_value_value truncates a value like this, we also need to
	return the shorter length to the user as well.

2011-04-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Really fix the case where a UTF-16 string contains junk after the string.
	The previous commit b71b88f588f8660935a7d462e97b84aa2d669249 attempted
	to fix this, but got the test the wrong way round so the length would
	never be shorter.

	regedit: Add implicit nul-termination when importing strings.
	When you import a string value like:
	  "Foo"="Bar"
	using Windows regedit program, implicit nul-termination is added
	to the value (not the key), so what is stored in the value would
	be something like:
	  hex(1):42,00,61,00,72,00,00,00
	where two of the trailing zero bytes come from the implicit
	terminator.  This corrects the reg_import function so it works

	Move test images to images/ and add a large, generated test image.
	Previously we had one minimal test image.  This was located in
	hivex/t (a subdirectory of the main library).

	This adds a large, procedurally generated test image.  Because
	this needs to be built using hivex code, and because subdirectories
	are built before the parent directory by automake, we have to
	also move the directory location to a top-level directory called
	images/.

	hivex: Fix allocations that may move C heap buffer.
	When heavily extending existing hive files, the malloc-allocated
	in-memory copy of the hive may be moved when we reallocate it
	(to increase its size).  However we didn't adjust existing
	pointers to cope with this, so sometimes you could get a segfault.

	This patch fixes the issue by adjusting pointers as necessary
	after calling (directly or indirectly) to the allocate_block
	function.

	With this patch I was able to allocate 10,000's of blocks in
	a deeply nested hive structure without any problems being reported
	by valgrind.

2010-02-23  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Link gnulib in to the hivex library, not end-user programs.
	Gnulib should be statically linked into the hivex library, so
	it gets included into end-user programs automatically.  Otherwise
	end-user programs would have to link explicitly with gnulib.

	generator: More minor formatting adjustments to POD documentation.

	generator: Minor adjustments to the C POD documentation.

	Add a generator for generating bindings to other languages.
	At the moment the generator just generates the C header file

	gnulib: Include xstrtol, xstrtoll modules.
	These were omitted from the earlier code import from libguestfs.

	Add html/ directory, include POD CSS.

	hivexsh: Print hex bytes >= 0x80 correctly.
	These were being interpreted as signed chars, and thus printed
	as "ffffff80" etc.

	Remove some unused variables.
	Since we have to compile with -Wno-unused-variables, we don't
	spot unused variables in code.  I found these by compiling the

	hivexsh: Remove unused variable.
	This removes an unused variable left over by
	commit ab608f3948d903af64e814b2e67949a1a71d93a4.

	hivex: Complete the implementation of adding child nodes.

	hivex: More debugging around nk 'unknown2' field.

	hivex: Check hash fields in lf/lh records.

	hivexsh: del command: Fix error message.

	hivexsh: lsval: Remove stray quotation mark.

	hivexsh: cd command: fix error handling
	The error behaviour of hivex_node_get_child is subtle, so the 'cd'
	command wouldn't always report errors correctly.  This fixes it.

	hivex: allocate_block should update valid block bitmap.
	The internal allocate_block() function wasn't updating the bitmap,
	so if you revisited a block which you had allocated in the same
	session, you could get an EFAULT error.

	hivex: More debug messages.

	hivex: Documentation update.
	ntreg_lf_record can have id "lf" (old-style hashes) or "lh" (new-
	style hashes).

	hivex: Some missing le32toh endianness conversions.

	hivexsh: Document some peculiarities of the "cd" command.

	hivex: Implement deleting child nodes.

	hivex: Add flags argument to internal get_children() function.
	When we later call get_children to visit the intermediate
	ri/lf/lh records, we have already deleted the subkey nk-records,
	so checking that those nk-records are still valid is not very
	helpful.

	This commit adds a flag to turn these checks off.

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Don't die on valid registries which have bad declared data lengths.
	Some apparently valid registries contain value data length
	declarations which exceed the allocated block size for the
	value.

	Previously the code would return EFAULT for such registries.
	However since these appear to be otherwise valid registries,
	turn this into a warning and just use the allocated block size
	as the data length (in other words, truncate the value).

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Minimal registry example.
	This is the smallest registry you can make and still have it
	load correctly in Windows regedit.

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivexsh: Add 'setval' and 'commit' commands.
	This adds the 'setval' and 'commit' commands to the hivex shell.

	Also adds some example scripts showing use of these.

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Begin implementation of writing to hives.
	This implements hivex_node_set_values which is used to
	delete the (key, value) pairs at a node and optionally
	replace them with a new set.

	This also implements hivex_commit which is used to commit
	changes to hives back to disk.

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Add HIVEX_OPEN_WRITE flag to allow hive to be opened for writing.
	If this flag is omitted (as in the case for all existing callers)
	then the hive is still opened read-only.

	We add a 'writable' flag to the hive handle, and we change the way
	that the hive file (data) is stored.  The data is still mmapped if
	the file is opened read-only, since that is more efficient and allows
	us to handle larger hives.  However if we need to write to the file
	then we have to read it all into memory, since if we had to extend the
	file we need to realloc that data.

	Note the manpage section L</WRITING TO HIVE FILES> comes in a later
	commit.

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Tools for analyzing and reverse engineering hive files.
	This commit is not of general interest.  It contains the tools which
	I used to reverse engineer the hive format and to test changes.
	Keeping these with the rest of the code is useful in case in future
	we encounter a hive file that we fail to modify.

	Note that the tools are not compiled by default.  You have to compile
	each explicitly with:

	  make -C hivex/tools <toolname>.opt

	You will also need ocaml-extlib-devel and ocaml-bitstring-devel.

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivexsh: Change some exit(1) -> exit(EXIT_FAILURE)

	hivexsh: Only print final \n when interactive.
	When hivexsh was called non-interactively, it would print an
	annoying extra line.  Only print this line if we are being
	used interactively.

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivexsh: Change handling of prompt argument to rl_gets()
	Make the result of isatty into a global variable (is_tty).

	Change the rl_gets() function so it takes the prompt string
	instead of a "display prompt?" flag.  rl_gets() then consults
	the global to find out if it should display the prompt at all.

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Document that this flag is clear for default keys.

	Misc documentation and gitignore update.

	Move htole*/le*toh macros into a separate header file.
	This allows us to reuse these macros in hivexsh later.

	hivex: Reimplement hivexget as a simple shell script.
	hivexget is currently a large C program.  Now that we have hivexsh
	(the shell) we can reimplement hivexget as a simple bash script that
	calls out to hivexsh.

	hivex: Add 'hivexsh' program (shell for navigating registry hives).

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Set locale in C programs so l10n works (RHBZ#559962).
	This commit adds the calls to setlocale &c to all of the current
	C programs.

	It also adds l10n support to hivexget and hivexml which lacked them
	previously.

	To test this, try:

	LANG=pa_IN.UTF-8 guestfish --cmd-help

	(You can only do this test after installing the package, or at
	least the 'pa.mo' mo-file in the correct place).

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Const-correctness fix on header_checksum (thanks Jim Meyering).

	hivex: Update some previously unknown nk-record fields.
	Update these fields with what we found out from reverse engineering
	the file.  Also bring the unknownX field names into line with
	visualizer.ml.

	hivex: Fix calculation of block size for vk data blocks.

	hivex: Display incorrect block size as unsigned in an error message.

	hivex: display bad block offset in hex

	hivex: hive type in vk-record is an unsigned 32 bit int

	hivex: Add missing le32toh conversion around field access.
	This was missing.  It only worked because we test on a little
	endian platform.

	hivex: Clarify some more fields.
	Taken from sentinelchicken.com documentation.

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Modify children/values functions to return intermediate blocks.
	Modify the functions that return child subnodes and values so they
	can also be used to return a list of the intermediate blocks.  This
	is so we can delete those intermediate blocks (in a later commit).

	We also introduce an offset_list structure which is used for collecting
	lists of offsets, ie. lists of nodes, values or blocks.

	Note that this commit should not change the semantics of the code.

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Add value_any callback to the visitor.
	The visitor currently contains lots of value_* callbacks, such as
	value_string which is called back when the value has type string.

	This is fine but it makes it complicated to deal with the case where
	you just want to see 'a value', and don't care about its type.

	The value_any callback allows visitors to see values generically.

2010-02-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Move header checksum code into a function.
	This function can be reused later.

	hivex: page 'offset_next' field is really 'page_size'.
	The documentation, as usual, is contradictory.  However this
	field is definitely the page size in all observed registries.
	Furthermore the following field marked 'unknown' is always
	zero, although this contradicts what the sentinelchicken.com
	paper says.

	hivex: Collect more statistics about registries.

	hivex: Store filename in hive handle.

	hivex: Various improvements in header parsing, thanks to better documentation.

	hivex: Print header fields.  Print all offsets in hex (in debug output).

	hivex: Reenable checksum calculations, but don't check result.

	hivex: Update documentation.

	hivex: Send all debug messages to stderr.

	hivex: Remove stray debugging message.

	hivex: Documentation: Add environment variables section.

	hivex: Whitespace change.

	hivex: Move STR* macros into C file.
	Don't pollute the public header file with these macros.

	hivex: Small updates to the documentation.

	Support for Windows Registry.
	In hivex/:  This mini-library allows us to extract Windows
	Registry binary files ("hives").

	There are also two tools: hivexml converts a hive to a
	self-describing XML format.  hivexget can be used to extract
	single subkeys from a hive.
