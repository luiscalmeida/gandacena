This directory contains test images for the hivex library.

'minimal' is a valid registry containing a single root nk (with
associated sk) which was created by chopping out everything possible
from a Windows 2003 software hive and then doing lots of hand edits on
the result.  There is no "source" for it as such, it is just a
hand-crafted binary blob.

'large' is a procedurally generated, large hive.  The program
'mklarge.c' is used to make this during the build.  It is used during
tests.

'special' was created by importing 'minimal' into a VM running Windows
XP, loading it into HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\minimal using regedit.exe
(File/Load Hive...), and running 'mkzero.exe'.

'mkzero.exe' creates the following keys and values:

- A key 'zero\0key' containing a REG_DWORD value 'zero\0val' (\0 = zero
  character)
- A key 'asdf_äöüß' containing a REG_DWORD value 'asdf_äöüß'
- A key 'weird™' containing a REG_DWORD value 'symbols $£₤₧€' (SMALL
  DOLLAR SIGN, FULLWIDTH POUND SIGN, PESETA SIGN, EURO SIGN)
