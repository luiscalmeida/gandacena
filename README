    *************************** ABOUT THIS TOOL *******************************
    
    Xtractor is a post-mortem forensic tool implemented in python and designed to run on linux operating systems to examine Windows 7 images.
    It will expect a file system image (dd image or vmdk image) as input and will extract certain data from the file system's windows registry, event log and other sources.
    It was developed by a team of three young IT engineers as a subject of Ciber Security Forensic course.
